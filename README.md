## 🧠 Executive Summary

I am a **systems-driven full-stack engineer** with strong grounding in  
**cybersecurity, AI engineering, analytics, healthcare compliance, and business strategy**.

I don’t build features in isolation — I design **complete platforms**:
- Secure by default  
- AI-assisted, human-controlled  
- Monetizable and scalable  
- MVP → Pro → Enterprise ready  

My work reflects **CTO-level ownership** of architecture, security, cost, and long-term maintainability.
